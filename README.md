	The company has the major areas of retail financial services to the individiual customer covered.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	This will require some investment on their part to integrate the option to purchase crypocurrencies into their website and app. Perhaps they can follow Square as a template for doing that.
